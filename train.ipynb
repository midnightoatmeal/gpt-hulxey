      " \"I am a man and alive,\" wrote D. H. Lawrence. \"F or this reason I am a noveli st. And, being a novelist, I \n",
      "consider myself superior to the sain t, the scientist, the philosopher, and the poet, who are all great masters of \n",
      "different bits of man alive, but never get the whole hog. . . Only in the novel are all things given full play.\" \n",
      " What is true of the novel is only a little less true of the essay. For, li ke the novel, the e ssay is a literary \n",
      "device for saying almost everything about almost anything. By tradition, almost by defi nition, the essay is a short \n",
      "piece, and it is therefore impossible to give all things full play within the limits of a single essay. But a collection \n",
      "of essays can cover almost as much ground, and cover it  almost as thoroughly as can a long novel. Montaigne's \n",
      "Third Book is the equivalent, very nearly, of a good slice of the Comédie Humaine. \n",
      " Essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variab ility can be studied most effectively within a three-\n",
      "poled frame of reference. There is the pole of the pe rsonal and the autobiographical; there is the pole of the \n",
      "objective, the factual, the concrete-particular; and there is  the pole of the abstract-universal. Most essayists are at \n",
      "home and at their best in the neighborhood of only one of the essay's three poles,  or at the most only in the \n",
      "neighborhood of two of them. There are the predominantly personal essayists,  who write fragments of reflective \n",
      "autobiography and who look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description. There are the \n",
      "predominantly objective essayists who do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some \n",
      "literary or scientific or political theme. Their art c onsists in setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing \n",
      "general conclusions from, the relevant data. In a third group we find those essayists who do their work in the world \n",
      "of high abstractions, who never condesce nd to be personal and who hardly dei gn to take notice of the particular \n",
      "facts, from which their generalizations were originally drawn. Each kind of essay has its special merits and defects. \n",
      "The personal essayists may be as good as Charles Lamb at hi s best, or as bad as Mr. X at  his cutest and most self-\n",
      "consciously whimsical. The objective essay may be as lively, as brassily contentious as a piece by Macaulay; but it \n",
      "may also, with fatal ease, degenerate into something merely informative or, if it be critical, into something merely \n",
      "learned and academic. And how splendid, how truly oracular ar e the utterances of the gr eat generalizes! \"He that \n",
      "hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue \n",
      "or mischief.\" And from Bacon we pass to Emerson. \"All  men plume themselves on the improvement of society, \n",
      "and no man improves. Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. For everything \n",
      "that is given, something is taken.\" Ev en a Baltasar Gracian, that briefest of essayists who writes as though he were \n",
      "cabling his wisdom, at two dollars a word, to the Anti podes, sometimes achieves a cer tain magnificence. \"Things \n",
      "have their period; even excellences are subject to fashion. The sage has one advantage: he is immortal. If this is not \n",
      "his century, many others will be.\" But the medal of solemn and lapidary generalization has its reverse. The \n",
      "constantly abstract, constantly impersonal essayist is apt to  give us not oracles but alge bra. As an example of such \n",
      "algebraic writing, let me quote a short passage from  the English translation of Paul Valéry's Dialogues. It is worth \n",
      "remarking that French literature has a tradition of high a nd sustained abstraction; English literature has not. Works \n",
      "that in French are not at all out of the common seem, when  translated, strange almost to the point of absurdity. But \n",
      "even when made acceptable by tradition and a great talent, th e algebraic style strikes us as being very remote from \n",
      "the living reality of our immediate experi ence. Here, in the words of an imagin ary Socrates, is Valery's description \n",
      "of the kind of language in which (as I think, unfortunately ) he liked to write. \"What is more mysterious than \n",
      "clarity? what more capricious than the way in which light  and shade are distributed over the hours and over men? \n",
      "Certain peoples lose themselves in th eir thoughts, but for the Greeks all things are form s. We retain only their \n",
      "relations and, enclosed, as it were, in the limpid day, Orpheus like we buil d, by means of the word, temples of \n",
      "wisdom and science that may suffice fo r all reasonable creatures. This great ar t requires of us an admirably exact \n",
      "language. The very word that signifies language is also the name, with us, for reason and calcul ation; the same \n",
      "word says these three things.\" In the stratosphere of abst ract notions this elegant alge bra is all very well; but a \n",
      "completely bodiless language can never do justice to th e data of immediate experience, nor can it contribute \n",
      "anything to our understanding of the \"capricious lights and shades\" in the midst of which, whether we like it or not, \n",
      "we must perforce live out our lives. \n",
      " The most richly satisfying essays ar e those which make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three \n",
      "worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.  Freely, effortlessly, thought and feeling move in these \n",

      "great and marvelous exception. By the time he had written his way into the Third Book, he had reached the limits \n",
